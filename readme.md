# Utils



## Intro

The "utils" Iâ€™m referring to are small functions that can address minor issues we might encounter. Maybe colleagues have something to contribute. Feel free to fork the repo, and make a pull request, and share it with others.

### Utils List
#### - Unmarshal
The unmarshal function created is camelCase-sensitive, meaning it ignores JSON tags that are not in camelCase. This situation typically arises in request bodies, where using json.Unmarshal can result in fields in snake_case or lowercase being interpreted as camelCase in the struct.
